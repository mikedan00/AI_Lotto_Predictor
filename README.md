# Learning AI with Python Through Lottery Prediction — Source Code

This repository contains the **official companion source code** for the book  
**_Learning AI with Python Through Lottery Prediction_**.

You will find **Colab-ready notebooks**, reusable **Python modules**, **backtesting utilities**, and **visualization tools** used throughout the book.

> **Disclaimer**  
> This project is provided for **educational and research purposes only**. Lottery outcomes are random, and this code **does not guarantee** any winnings.

You may use, modify, and share this code for **personal, educational, and research purposes only**.

## What’s Inside

- Data loading and validation (CSV-based)
- Feature engineering for lottery time series
- Traditional baselines (frequency, gaps, heuristic strategies)
- Deep learning models (e.g., LSTM / Transformer variants if included in your build)
- Backtesting (holdout / walk-forward)
- Visualization (hit distributions, trends, correlations, moving sums, etc.)
- English-only plot labels (to avoid font issues with Korean text in some environments)
